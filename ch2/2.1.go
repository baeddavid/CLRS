Initialization:
We know that all values prior to the first loop are not equal to the key. Before we start looping we
can return NIL which is a valid return

Maintenance:
Our idx variable will hold NIL until either we terminate out of the loop or we find a value equal to v

Termination:
When we exit the loop we have either NIL or idx where A[idx] is equal to v
